# Weather and Climate Simulation App
## Section I:

Title: Weather/Climate Simulation App

Description: To find out the weather conditions in certain cities, that people might need to use if they are traveling, or if they want to know what the weather conditions are in their area, or somewhere else

Target Browser: The target browser would be iOS-focused, because since people are traveling, they would like to know the weather of a place.

“See Section II, Developer Manual to understand how to operate the application”

## Section II, Developer Manual: 

As you are reading this developer manual, here are some stuff to keep in mind when using this. In order to do this, please make a versel account and link the GitHub to your application. You should be able to deploy all the materials

1# Install Vercel, as you are able to run the servers there

2# Connect this GitHub to the Vercel Server that you created and link the GitHub there

3# To Run The Application, the server is hosted at 3000, so you would have to go to the terminal and do npm start. 

4# As you can see the Vercel is acting up as it should and you should be able to navigate through the application. Running test would require checking all the functionalities that are working.

### Functions

For the API that I'm using for this application. I'm using an api called WeatherStack, which is about the weather and climate around the world. The project is supposed to  "get" the HTML links in the project" while the post does for this project the results the user inputs from the WeatherHistory.html. Which is called the simulation of finding the weather

Some of the expectations you may find in this application is how to do find weather and what you should do if that weather happens to be in your area
